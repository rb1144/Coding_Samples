# CodingSamples

Hello - this repository is meant to illustrate the kinds of programs that I have written to date in R, Python, SAS and SQL. 

The (vast) majority of my scripts were written for project-specific tasks and are not included here. Instead what I am sharing consists mostly of functions and macros: the building blocks that I have been using to automate various steps, ranging from general purpose scripting (file search, copy, compress, concatenate, content search, find and replace, file comparisons, etc.) to SQL queries, data processing, data pipelines, data visualization, data analysis, statistics and modeling.

Perhaps the best of the crop is a space shooter game that I wrote in Python, and which will run if you open it in the iOS app Pythonista. ;-) 

Thanks, B.
